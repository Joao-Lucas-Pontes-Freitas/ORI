Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don't know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closing in
And the devil's knocking at my door, whoa
Outta my mind, how many times
Did I tell you I'm no good at being alone?
Yeah, it's taking a toll on me, trying my best to keep
From tearing the skin off my bones, don't you know
I lose control
When you're not next to me? (When you're not here)
I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me, mm
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
Problematic, problem is
I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habit's hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know, I could do it on my own
But I want that real full moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic, problem is
When I'm with you, I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darling please, oh
I lose control
When you're not next to me (when you're not here)
I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
I lose control
When you're not here with me
I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm
You're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
